/**
* Additional Information:
*
* This template comes with several examples of how you can use the 
* Behavior helper scripts to add interactivity to your Lens. 
* 
* Behavior itself does not contain the effect, but rather trigger effects in the scene.
* 
* You can add Behavior in your project, by pressing `+` in 
* the Objects or Resources panel, and under `Helper Scripts` choose Behavior. 
* 
* Behavior itself is just a Javascript file, and you can open it to see how it works. 
* In the same way, you can use Behavior by adding the script to any object. 
* 
* Tip: when an input references an object in the scene, you can right click the field 
* and select `highlight` to find the referenced object. 
* 
* Tip 2: You can put Behavior anywhere, however Lens Studio will run 
* Behavior in the order they appear in the Objects panel. 
*
* Tip 3: If you want to use Custom Trigger in your own script, make sure to have 
* a Behavior script higher in the Objects panel, even if it triggers or respond with nothing
*
* To see the list of all avaiable trigger and responses, 
* take a look at the information on the Behavior page:
